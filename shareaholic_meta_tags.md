Shareaholic Content Meta Tags
---

If you would like, you can provide Shareaholic with more information about your content. This is done via Shareaholic Content Meta Tags.  These meta tags are placed in the <head> of your webpage. You can also use a generic meta tag, an Open Graph tag (og:), Twitter tag (twitter:) or a Shareaholic-specific meta tag. The latter overrides the former in all cases.
