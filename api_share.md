Shareaholic JavaScript SDK looks for the following hints, *in this specific order*, to determine the URL to display Share Counts for:

1. **The "data-link" attribute**.  For example:
`<div class='shareaholic-canvas' data-app='share_buttons' data-app-id="xxx" data-title='Page Title' data-link='http://www.yourwebsite.com/'></div>`
2. **Shareaholic URL Meta Tag**. For example: `<meta name="shareaholic:url" content="http://www.yourwebsite.com/" />`
3. **Canonical Meta Tag**. For example: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://blog.shareaholic.com/" />`
4. **Open Graph URL Meta Tag**. For example: `<meta name="og:url" content="http://www.yourwebsite.com/" />`
5. The URL displayed in the web browser address bar

> * Note: if you're using either our WordPress or Drupal plugin, data-link and the Shareaholic URL Meta tags are set automatically.
